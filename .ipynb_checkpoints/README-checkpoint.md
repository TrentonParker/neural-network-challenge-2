# neural-network-challenge-2

**This challenge involved importing and exploring data, selecting features, and preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and standardizing features. The model was designed with shared layers and two output branches for predicting department and attrition, and compiled and trained on the preprocessed data. Finally, the model was evaluated on the test set, and accuracy metrics were reported for both target variables (.79 for attrition accuracy and .61 for department accuracy).**
